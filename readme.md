Today I made a dockerized backend app and deployed it using google cloud run.

Next, I would like to:
0. Bundle and serve the frontend with watching for development.
1. Enable a user to enter gas tracker items. This should store the car name, total miles driven, gas amount purchased, and cost of the gas.
2. Save the entered gas tracker items in the browsers localStorage so that I can continue to use the app.
3. Download/upload a file with the data (upload to localStorage).
4. Backend persistence???
