Next, I would like to:
1. Download/upload a file with the data (upload to localStorage).
1. Backend persistence???
1. Data analysis report using the gas tracker data.
 
Fifth Day
1. [DONE] add typescript.
1. [DONE] hosting cert is good.
1. [DONE] add google cloud armor with rate limiting rule.
1. [DONE] refactor the types to remove the view helpers. 

Fourth Day
1. [DONE] Add an action to delete a record.
1. [DONE] Present the data in a table.
1. [DONE] Refactor the frontend to make it more modular.
1. [ISSUE] The global reload method is meh. It might be nice to add a more feature rich storage option (redux?).

Third Day
1. [DONE] Add lit element integration for the gas data view table.
1. [DONE] Add webpack build (turned into lib, but next time should try to build as module).

Second Day
1. [DONE] Bundle and serve the frontend with watching for development.
1. [DONE] Enable a user to enter gas tracker items. This should store the car name, total miles driven, gas amount purchased, and cost of the gas.
1. [DONE] Save the entered gas tracker items in the browsers localStorage so that I can continue to use the app.

First Day:
Today I made a dockerized backend app and deployed it using google cloud run.
